# The End

That's it. Believe it or not, you have completed this comprehensive SOLID course for AL, and you have learned how to apply SOLID principles in your real-life projects.

The solution at this moment follows quite a lot of good principles, and is far more flexible, maintainable, testable, extensible than before. It's not perfect - the room for improvement is the largest room in the world, they say - but it's still a lot better than what it looked like when you started this workshop.

I hope you enjoyed this experience and learned a lot from it. If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me at vjeko@vjeko.com.

See you in the cloud!
