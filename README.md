# 05 DIP: Dependency Inversion Principle 

There is no exercise here. This state of the solution can show you a different take onto the DIP and how it can be applied. This time, it's all about testability.

The code in this branch applies DIP heavily to make the code far more testable than it was before. This is a legitimate design goal, and if you have it, here's how you can do it.

Some of you will find this "overengineered", too complex, too abstract, and you may be right. This example takes it to the very extreme, and in real life you don't have to go that far. This example is not to show you that this is how you *must* do it, only how you *may* do it if you want to. DIP has a very strong connection to testability, and this is what this example is about.
